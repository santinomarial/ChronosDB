# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) preserve the context and reasoning behind consequential project choices. An ADR is required when a decision changes a durable or network contract, an invariant, component ownership, concurrency or memory-ordering strategy, recovery/consistency semantics, security boundary, production dependency, supported platform, compatibility policy, or a choice that would be expensive to reverse. Routine local implementation details that follow accepted specifications do not need an ADR.

## Numbering and filenames

Use a four-digit, monotonically increasing repository-wide number followed by a short lowercase hyphenated title:

```text
0001-wal-durability-modes.md
0002-cseg-v1-layout.md
```

Reserve the number when opening the ADR. Numbers are never reused, even when a proposal is rejected. This file will list ADRs in number order once records exist; there are no decisions recorded yet.

## Statuses

- **proposed:** under review and not an implementation authority.
- **accepted:** approved and authoritative for work in its scope.
- **superseded:** replaced by one or more named ADRs; retained for history.
- **rejected:** considered and deliberately not selected; retained with rationale.
- **deprecated:** once accepted, but no longer recommended or valid for new work; migration may still be underway.

## Process

1. Copy [the template](template.md), allocate the next number, and fill every section. Use `None` with a reason rather than deleting a section.
2. Link the affected [invariants](../architecture/invariants.md), specifications, benchmarks, prototypes, and issue discussions that actually exist. Do not invent references.
3. Review alternatives, failure modes, compatibility, operations, and validation evidence before changing status to `accepted`.
4. Record implementation follow-ups outside the ADR while keeping links back to the decision.
5. When the decision changes, add a new ADR and update both records' statuses and cross-references.

An accepted ADR is not silently rewritten after implementation begins. Correct typographical errors or add clearly labeled retrospective notes without changing the original decision. A semantic change, new tradeoff, or reversed decision requires a new ADR so the project's history remains reviewable.

## Index

No ADRs have been proposed or accepted yet.
