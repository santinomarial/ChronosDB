# Native client session

`NativeClientSession` makes the Protocol v1 client state executable without owning a socket. The
caller copies its `pending_write()` bytes to any transport, reports the exact consumed prefix, and
feeds arbitrary received fragments back through `receive()`.

The session owns bounded connection buffers and a pre-reserved active-request vector. IDs advance
only after a complete request enters bounded output, so allocation or backpressure cannot burn or
reuse identity. Decoded response frames own payload bytes; query-batch views created from them must
not outlive those bytes.

Handshake, query result, ingest durability, cancellation, errors, and PONG each have explicit state
checks. Protocol errors fail closed and release all retained bytes. Complexity is linear in handled
bytes plus the finite active-request search; completed output-frame removal is linear in the finite
queued-frame bound.
